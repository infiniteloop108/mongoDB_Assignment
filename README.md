Learning MongoDB
================

- This is an assignment to familiarize yourself with mongoDB and learn the basic commands.

- The exercises are given in Assignment3.pdf

- The answer queries (raw) are given in queries.txt and the output(where required) is present as set\_question.json

- For questions in which output is required, a .js file is made with slight modification over the raw query which iterates over the output and pretty-prints it.

- Run them as `mongo < 1_1.js > 1_1.json`
